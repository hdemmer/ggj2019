# Nine Lives - Global Game Jam 2019

The cat has lived in this house for nine lives. All memories of the place are coming slowly back to it. It's looking for an item it remembers. It knows where, but not when.

Play the game at [https://hdemmer.github.io/ggj2019/](https://hdemmer.github.io/ggj2019/)

### How to play
You control only the silder at the bottom. Use it to find the timeline the cat remembers the item in. With every item found, more of the past memories unlock.
